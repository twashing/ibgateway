# Overview

This namespace contains tools for performing technical analysis on stock data. The packages will be organised as follows.


## Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators are ones that follow price movements and have less predictive qualities. The most well-known lagging indicators are the moving averages and Bollinger BandsÂ®. The usefulness of these indicators tends to be lower during non-trending periods but highly useful during trending periods. This is due to the fact that lagging indicators tend to focus more on the trend and produce fewer buy-and-sell signals. This allows the trader to capture more of the trend instead of being forced out of their position based on the volatile nature of the leading indicators.

## Leading Indicators

Leading indicators are those created to proceed the price movements of a security giving predictive qualities. A leading indicator is thought to be the strongest during periods of sideways or non-trending trading ranges, while the lagging indicators are regarded as more useful during trending periods. Users need to be careful to make sure the indicator is heading in the same direction as the trend.

## Confirming Indicators

- [On Balance Volume](http://www.investopedia.com/university/indicator_oscillator/ind_osc2.asp): The On Balance Volume indicator is used to measure the positive and negative flow of volume in a security relative to its price over time. This measure expands on the basic volume measure by combining volume and price movement. The idea behind this indicator is that volume precedes price movement, so if a security is seeing an increasing OBV it is a signal that volume is increasing on upward price moves. Decreases mean that the security is seeing increasing volume on down days. See also [here](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:on_balance_volume)
